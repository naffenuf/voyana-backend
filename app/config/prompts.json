Once home to the Rosenwach Water Tank Company, the building retains its brick-and-steel character while hosting a modern hotel designed to draw in both locals and travelers. Inside, its public spaces buzz with conversation and collaboration, framed by vintage decor and skyline views. The Hoxton's story is tightly woven into that of Williamsburg itself — a neighborhood shaped by waves of immigration, artistic reinvention, and entrepreneurial energy.\n\nTarget length: 150–250 words, or longer for major landmarks or sites with particularly interesting details.
